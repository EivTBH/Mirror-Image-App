# Mirror Image Photography

A small app that matches a website I created. This is my first forray into XAML/.net Maui so be kind.

The lack of documentation on Maui is insane. The fact that everything is "will be introduced in future update" drives me nuts.
Yet we are asked to use this tool that is so new, our lecturer is having to learn it on the go (hes done a great job with the tools at hand).
The higher ups didn't care so we just got on with it. This is the first version of my app so it will improve over time when I get more
comfortable with the toolset.
